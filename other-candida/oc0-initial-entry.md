# oc0 - Initial Entry

**Date:** 2025-06-22
**System:** Local or Cluster
**Project:** other-candida

## Objective
Here I am recording the initial entry for all other candidas that are not C. glabrata. If these 
get divided up into individual species, it will still be recorded in this notebook. They are 
grouped because there are ~480 of them all together, while there were about as many glabratas.

## Inputs
487 pairs of fastq files were downloaded from CAGEF. These are found in:
- `/media/user/DATA/other-candida/raw-fastq/`

I do not have the metadata for these sequences yet. I asked Julianne but she said Lisa must get 
back from her vacation to send it...(lame).


## Notes
37515 had 2 sets of files, one with '-S245' and the other with '-S45' appended to its name. I kept 
both for now. These account for 2 of the 487 samples...

44174 F/R files were empty files, suggesting these failed sequencing, so this sample falls out at 
this point...

**Leaving 486 samples**

The empty files (for record's sake) are found in `/media/user/DATA/other-candida/bad-raw-fastq/`.
